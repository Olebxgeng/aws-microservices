This project uses Terraform to create a simple, scalable, and cost-optimized AWS infrastructure for a microservices app. It sets up:

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private networks. EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) that automatically add/remove servers based on CPU usage. An RDS database (PostgreSQL) for storing app data.
